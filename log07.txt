    Welcome back! In the last log, I got string literals
    working with the 'quote' word.

    One thing lead to another and I ended up solving a lot
    of different problems so that now I can define words
    not just from "primitives" (machine code words written
    in assembler), but also words composed from *other*
    non-primitive words.

    So yeah, you can only make programs that print strings,
    but they are real programs.

    Okay, so now the fun TODOs!

        [ ] Pretty-print meta info about word!
        [ ] Loop through dictionary, list all names
        [ ] Loop through dictionary, pretty-print all

    (And I'm not being sarcastic - I'm looking forward to
    these.)
