    The last update was very exciting. Now I'm actually
    reading a single word's definition from a string,
    inlining all of the code into memory, and executing it.

    To put it in concrete terms, this 'meow5' definition:

        "meow meow meow meow meow exit"

    Was turned into this in memory:

        <meow word machine code>
        <meow word machine code>
        <meow word machine code>
        <meow word machine code>
        <exit word machine code>

    The 'exit' word even pops the exit status code from the
    stack. Between that and all of the meowing, we're
    getting extremely "conCATenative" here. Sorry.

    So I need to figure out what step comes next. I need to:

        1. Get user input from STDIN
        2. Figure out how immediate mode will work
           (currently, i start in compile mode and when
           that's done, I execute whatever was compiled!)
        3. Create the colon ':' and semicolon ';' words to
           toggle compile mode (and create word definitions!)

    I would also like to have introspection and diagnostics
    and visualizations as early in this project as possible!
    But for now, I'm gonna stay the course towards an
    absolutely minimumal proof of concept. I want to be able
    to type this:

        : meow5 meow meow meow meow meow exit ;
        meow5

    And see (something like) this:

        Meow.
        Meow.
        Meow.
        Meow.
        Meow.
        BYE!
        $

    So how about #2 and/or #3 from the list above - how
    simple can the colon command be?

    So I've updated the input string:

        db 'meow  : meow5 meow meow meow meow meow ;
            meow5 exit', 0

    (ignore the newline)
    Which reads as:

        1. call meow right now in "immediate" mode
        2. : switches to compile mode and
        3. store "meow5" as name
        4. inline 5 meow words
        5. ; writes tail (including saved name) and
        6. switches back to immediate mode
        7. call new meow5 word
        8. exit

    and have created a mode var and added imm/comp flags to
    tails. todo:

    [ ] colon word store name somewhere
    [ ] find should also match mode flag (use &)
    [ ] semicolon should write tail
    [ ] immediate mode should find and exec words...somehow
