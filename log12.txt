    Okay, so here's the plan. I'm going to get Meow5 to the
    point where it can write out working ELF files that can
    print the "meow" repetition example that inspired the
    name of this language/program.

    To do that, I need to:

        1. Write the 'data_area' to 'free' (where strings
           are stored) to the ELF file after the executable
           portion.

        2. Update the ELF program header so it loads the
           additional data.

        3. Ensure that the compiled executable can print the
           string from the memory loaded at runtime.

    The last one is the biggest challenge just because I'm
    not entirely sure how that's normally done.

    I could hack together something that works, but I'm more
    interested in learning how, say, GCC goes about it.
