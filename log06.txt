    Well, log05.txt ended with some great excitement. I
    double-checked and all of the open TODOs are now closed.

    So I think I'll dip into design-notes.txt and pick the
    next thing to do.

    I just remembered one thing, I need to _remove_ a
    feature: the return stack doesn't need to be a stack at
    all because my "inline all the things!" language can't
    have nested word calls anyway:

        [ ] Replace return stack with single addr

    So, that's not super rewarding, but I do enjoy deleting
    uneeded code.

    Oh, I know which feature I'm doing after that! Time to
    reward myself for staying on track with something fun
    and visual:

        [ ] Pretty-print meta info about word!
        [ ] Loop through dictionary, list all names
        [ ] Loop through dictionary, pretty-print all
