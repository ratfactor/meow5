    Howdy! So I've got immediate and compile modes basically
    working.  Now I've got two TODOs carrying over from the
    last log and I'll add some new ones. I'm gonna put this
    in the order I think they should probably be done, too:

        [ ] turn return_addr into a stack so i can call
            words from words
        [ ] make a "print" word and use it
        [ ] colon word store name somewhere
        [ ] semicolon should write tail

    From there, I think the roadmap will be fairly clear and
    largely driven by whatever I think will be useful or fun
    to grow the language.

        * Print dictionary/word tails
        * How to handle variables and strings
        * Interactive REPL
        * ANSI colors
        * Print current stack (automatically in REPL?)
        * Write out any word as an ELF executable?
        * Other debugging features?
        * Some simple benchmarks - size vs speed

    This whole thing is just an experiment in simplicity by
    taking a concept to extremes (in a good way) so I want
    to keep it tiny and comprehensible. Too many features
    will detract from that, so I'll need to pick them
    carefully.
