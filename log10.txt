    Hello! So it seems to me that there are two major paths
    to decide between for the thing to add next:

        * Control structures (if/else, loops)
        * Write compiled programs to ELF executables

    Both will be challenging. I'm leaning towards ELF at the
    moment. We'll see what I think when I come back tomorrow
    night.
