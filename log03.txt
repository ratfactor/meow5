    I left myself a nice easy one to start this log:

        [ ] Make all words take params from the stack, not
            from pre-defined registers.





	---------------------------------------------------------
    NOTE: I'm still using call/ret to use the 'find' and
    'inline' words when the program initially runs. I've got
    a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem here because without
    a return, these won't seamlessly move on to the next
    instructions when they're done and I can't find or
    inline them because THEY are 'find' and 'inline'!

    I feel like that will be solved when I've got more of
    the interpreter or REPL in place. If not, I've got a
    puzzle on my hands. For the moment, things are just a
	bit...messy.
